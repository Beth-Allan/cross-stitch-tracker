## Accumulated Context

### Key Architecture

- `src/lib/queries/stats/` for query layer (pure functions, no "use server")
- `unstable_cache` with `revalidateTag("stats")` on session mutations (5-min TTL + on-demand)
- Recharts always Client Components (SSR incompatible)
- `Promise.allSettled` for parallel data fetching (17 queries on stats page)

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `.env.local` bcrypt hashes must escape `$` as `\$`
